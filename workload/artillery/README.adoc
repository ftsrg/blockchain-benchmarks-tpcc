= TPC-C Chaincode Benchmark using Artillery

To run the benchmark, just execute

[source,console]
----
$ pnpm start
----

(Or `npm start` or `yarn start`, depending on which package manager you prefer).


== Benchmark configuration

The benchmark is configured in `tpcc-load-test.yml` using https://www.artillery.io/[Artilleryâ€™s] constructs.

.Some comments
* TPC-C chaincode transactions may take a long time to execute.
While Artillery is mainly designed to fire a lot of requests at high frequency (a stress test), we must ensure there is sufficient time between the requests.
For example, for a _phase_ of _duration_ 30, setting _arrivalCount_ to 15 and _arrivalRate_ to 1 ensures a request every 2 seconds.


== Results of benchmark runs

You can find results of benchmark runs in `logs`.
Normally, docker logs are collected and latency data is extracted into CSV files.
The log files are not included in the repo as they are rather large.

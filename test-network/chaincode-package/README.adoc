[IMPORTANT]
This is only a metadata package.
The actual chaincode runs externally, in _Chaincode-As-A-Service_ (_CCAAS_) mode.
Normally, there is no reason to change or do anything here, except if you want to change the chaincode label or the port it uses.

== Scripts

The link:scripts/[`scripts/`] directory contains some executables (POSIX shell scripts) to help with some common tasks:

* link:scripts/package[`package`]: Generates a new link:code.tar.gz[`code.tar.gz`] from link:connection.json[`connection.json`] and then a new link:tpcc.tgz[`tpcc.tgz`] from link:code.tar.gz[`code.tar.gz`] and link:metadata.json[`metadata.json`]; link:tpcc.tgz[`tpcc.tgz`] is what is deployed in the end to the peers
* link:scripts/calculate_package_id[`calculate_package_id`]: Spins up an ephemeral https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-tools[`hyperledger/fabric-tools`] Docker container to find out what the package ID is for link:tpcc.tgz[`tpcc.tgz`]; this needs to go into the link:../fabric-docker/docker-compose.yaml[compose file], the link:../fabric-docker/commands-generated.sh[`commands-generated.sh`] script, and the filename in link:../fabric-config/chahincode-packages/[the Fabric chaincode packages directory] must also match this value
* link:scripts/copy_to_fablo[`copy_to_fablo`]: Copies link:tpcc.tgz[`tpcc.tgz`] with the correct name (the package ID) to link:../fabric-config/chahincode-packages/[the Fabric chaincode packages directory] (internally uses link:scripts/calculate_package_id[`calculate_package_id`] as well)

CAUTION: Beware that tarballs also contain modification-time-related information and thus regenerating them with link:scripts/package[`package`] – while may seem and feel like changes nothing – changes the resulting package ID.
